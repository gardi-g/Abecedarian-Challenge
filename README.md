# Question
They are called strictly ABeCeDarian, because the letters within each word are in strictly increasing alphabetical order. 
In this challenge we will be writing a program to generate all strictly abecedarian strings that can be made from an alphabet.

# Input Format
The input will consist of a single string made up of letters and numbers. The characters inside the string will appear in alphabetical order.

# Constraints
The string will be no longer than 20 characters long.

# Output Format
Output, in alphabetical order, all non-empty, strictly abecedarian strings that can be made from the given alphabet.
